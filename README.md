# NFT Marketplace – Wallet Authentication & Portfolio Module (NDA Project)

**Note:** This is a portfolio description of a commercial, blockchain-based NFT trading platform developed under NDA. No source code is publicly shared.

## 🖼️ Project Overview

This project involved the creation of a decentralized NFT exchange platform that enables users to authenticate via blockchain wallets, trade NFTs, and build relationships with other collectors. The system provides real-time asset visibility, transaction overviews, and social graph features.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I worked as **one of three frontend developers** for about **4 months**. My main responsibilities included:

- Implementing **wallet-based authentication flow** using libraries like `wagmi`, `rainbowkit`, and `ethers`
- Building the **user wallet dashboard** that displays owned NFTs and established user connections
- Ensuring **secure and smooth wallet connection logic** and proper handling of token/session flows
- Creating responsive and consistent UIs based on **brutalist-style designs**
- Making autonomous design and UX decisions in areas where mockups were incomplete or missing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Framework & Runtime
- **Next.js 14**
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**

### Web3 Integration
- **wagmi**, **RainbowKit**, **ethers.js**
- WalletConnect support
- Session handling via `cookies-next` and `jsonwebtoken`

### State Management
- **Zustand** – lightweight global state
- **@tanstack/react-query** – data fetching and caching
- **TRPC** – end-to-end type-safe API communication

### UI & Styling
- **Mantine UI** – design system & components
- **Framer Motion** – animations
- **PostCSS**, **Sass**

### Validation & Utilities
- **Zod** – schema-based validation
- **clsx**, **date-fns**, **uuid**

### Testing & Tooling
- **Vitest**, **Playwright**
- **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **pnpm**

## 🔍 Highlights of My Work

- Delivered a **fully functional wallet login and logout experience** with session awareness and fallback states
- Designed and built the **wallet dashboard**, displaying NFT assets, connection statuses, and portfolio history
- Ensured compatibility with various wallet providers and edge-case error handling
- Participated in peer reviews and architectural discussions in a small, agile frontend team

## 🎨 Design Context

- The project used a **brutalist design approach**, but many parts of the UI were **underdesigned or missing entirely**
- I contributed significantly to layout and UX decisions, collaborating with the team to fill in gaps and keep design language consistent
